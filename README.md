# Coding-Quiz

This project is a simple coding quiz website created as practice for potential coding assessments. On this site, when the start button is pressed, a timer starts and the user is presented with multiple choice questions, one after another until all questions are complete. When the user gets a question wrong, the timer decreases by 10 seconds. When all questions are asnwered or the timer reaches 0, the game ends and the user can then enter their name and have their score added to the local scoreboard.

## Features
* Responsive layout that reacts and adjusts to device size.
* 5 questions of varying diffulculty to put your coding knowledge to the test.
* An active timer that ends the quiz when it hits 0.
* Pop-ups on the page that alert you if you got the question correct or not.
* A local scoreboard that stores user scores in local storage, letting users view their highscores any time they reopen the browser.
* A clear highscores button that lets the user reset their scoreboard. **Use of this button will delete the user's local storage scoreboard.**
* A sort function that ensures the user's scores are shown in descending order.
